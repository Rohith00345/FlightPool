## Phase 0: Audit & Architecture Review

- **Status**: Completed
- **Branch**: `production-upgrade`
- **Files Touched**:
  - `/docs/AUDIT.md` (created)
  - `/docs/PHASE_LOG.md` (created)
- **Summary**: Comprehensive audit of existing architecture, database models, API routes, security posture, and feature gap analysis against `/docs/production-features-and-architecture.md` and `/docs/schema.sql`.
- **Baseline Verification**: All 25 unit tests and 5 Playwright E2E tests verified green.
- **Risks Identified**:
  1. Ephemeral SQLite storage on Vercel serverless.
  2. Missing authentication & role-based authorization on `/admin`, `/driver`, and sensitive APIs.
  3. Dev OTP (`123456`) accepting any phone number.
  4. Floating point currency storage instead of integer paise.
  5. In-memory / client-driven timers for wait cap and pool expiry rather than server-side scheduler jobs.
- **Next Step**: STOP and request User approval / configuration for Phase 1 (PostgreSQL database provisioning & connection strings).
